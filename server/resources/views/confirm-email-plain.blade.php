Confirm your light!
In order to be able to feel a little bit more connected with all TU-students, three Christmas trees have been placed in front of the auditorium. These trees are lit with 25.000 lights, one for every TU student. You can turn your light on by clicking on the following button! When all lights are turned on, we’ve all thought of each other and we’ve reached every student. Would you help to turn us on?
