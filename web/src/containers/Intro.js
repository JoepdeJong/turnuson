                    <p>During the last and dark days of the December month, we are all looking forward to the Christmas break. While some of us will visit friends or family, other students might not be able to do so. As the Covid-situation hinders us to go to the campus, we don’t meet fellow students as much as before. As a result of this, there are a lot of students that feel lonely.</p>
                    <p>In order to be able to feel a little bit more connected with all TU-students, three Christmas trees have been placed in front of the auditorium. These trees are lit with 25.000 lights, one for every TU student. You can turn your light on by clicking on the button below and leaving your email in the form! When all lights are turned on, we’ve all thought of each other and we’ve reached every student. Would you help to turn us on?</p>
